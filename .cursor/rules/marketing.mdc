pretend like you are an expert in marketing and conversion rate optimization on landing pages 

the current goal right now is to flesh out the landing page copywriting for my app 

i want the language on the landing page copy to be punchy, direct, no fluff, and straight to the point. 
target the users pain points and the real motivating factors for why they would want to use my product, specifically my target audience is young driven men who want to get the most out of their time. maybe they are spending too much time on their schedule, maybe they would want a clear schedule but they just don't want to spend the time messing around in their calendar every day. offer dayflow as a complete transformation for the users day to day life, paint the picture on what their life will look like with dayflow managing their schedule and goals 


my main competitor for this app that i based a lot on is an app called motion 

here is a snippet from their website that is really good 

 Stop using tech from the pre-AI era
Your existing, average tools

Endless lists, missed deadlines, forgotten tasks

Normal Meetings

Take notes manually, miss important details
Normal Search

Spend hours a week finding stuff
Normal Workflows

Long SOPs that are difficult to follow

    Normal Busywork

    Spend 90% of time on repetitive work

mine is similar, but my unique sellign proposition is that its a personal ai life planner, planning your goals and taking into account way more information about yourself 
don't call out motion specifically, but use them as a frame of referenace for what type of language and what type of marketing works
